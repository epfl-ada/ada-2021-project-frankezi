## Abstract
**Evolution of sinophobic sentiment and propaganda in the United States of America from 2015 to 2020(in the article-centric database)** 
For the past few decades, China’s domestic growth and increased worldwide influence, along with economic and social instability in the US, have presented a threat to the idea of American exceptionalism. As a result, several prominent American political figures and media outlets have been fearmongering about the consequences of a stronger Chinese state. This, in turn, has increased anti-Asian and anti-Chinese sentiment among the general population, as exemplified in 2020 by the creation of *#StopAsianHate*, which aimed to bring to light the violent effect of scapegoating China for the Covid-19 pandemic on Asian-American citizens.

## Research Questions 
What we would like to address during the project:
First we would like to analyse a bit more the sinophobic sentiment in the USA through the quotes.
* Can we see an evolution of the sinophobic sentiment in the USA?
* What form does it have? (distribution?)
* If yes, is it correlated with some special events (COVID crisis, ...)? Are they sudden spikes?
* From where does the sinophobic sentiment come from: citizens? Political parties?

Then, we want to analyse the opposite part, aka those who raise theirs voices against this anti-Chinese sentiment.
* who has been advocating for the anti-racism?
* From where does it come from: from the Asian-American citizens or from non Asian-American citizens? Politicians or citizens?
* And how this defense takes place: through accusations (more violent) or by showing the absurdity of this sentiment (pedagogy)?

## Proposed additional datasets 
*List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.*

## Methods
The aim of this project would be to analyse the sentiment of quotes related to China thanks to an appropriate pre-trained model: ideally, we would be able to observe both the strength of the sentiment and the amount of polarised quotes within the dataset through time. 
* First evolution of sinophobic quotes throug graphs
* To gain a better understanding of the source, quotes would be sorted by their most likely speaker, keeping only those of American nationality, and further sorted by their occupation.
