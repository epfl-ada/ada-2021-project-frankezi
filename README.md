## Abstract: 
**Evolution of sinophobic sentiment and propaganda in the United States of America from 2015 to 2020** (in the article-centric database)

  For the past few decades, China’s domestic growth and increased worldwide influence, along with economic/social instability in the US, have presented a threat to the idea of American exceptionalism. As a result, several prominent American political figures and media outlets have been fearmongering about the consequences of a stronger Chinese state. This, in turn, has increased anti-Asian and in particular anti-Chinese sentiment among the general population, as exemplified in 2020 by *#StopAsianHate*, which aimed to bring to light the violent effect of scapegoating China for the Covid-19 pandemic on Asian-American citizens.
  The aim of this project would be to analyse the sentiment of quotes related to China thanks to an appropriate pre-trained model: ideally, we would be able to observe both the strength of the sentiment and the amount of polarised quotes within the dataset through time. To gain a better understanding of the source, quotes would be sorted by their most likely speaker, keeping only those of American nationality, and further sorted by their occupation.



## Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.


## Proposed additional datasets: 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
