## Abstract
**Evolution of sinophobic sentiment and propaganda in the United States of America from 2015 to 2020** <br/>
For the past few decades, Chinaâ€™s domestic growth and worldwide influence augmentation, along with economic and social instability in the US, have presented a threat to the idea of American exceptionalism. As a result, several prominent American political figures and media outlets have been fearmongering about the consequences of a stronger Chinese state. This, in turn, has increased anti-Asian and anti-Chinese sentiment among the general population, as exemplified in 2020 by the creation of *#StopAsianHate*, which aimed to bring to light the violent effect of scapegoating China for the Covid-19 pandemic on Asian-American citizens.

## Research Questions 
During this project, we would like to, firstly, analyse more the **sinophobic sentiment in the USA** through the quotes.
* Can we see an evolution of the sinophobic sentiment in the USA?
* What form/distribution does it have?
* If yes, is it correlated with some special events (COVID crisis, ...)? Are there sudden spikes?
* From which part of the population does the sinophobic sentiment come from: citizens? Political parties? From which generation/range of ages?

Secondly, we want to analyse the opposite part: those who raise theirs voices **against this anti-Chinese sentiment in the USA**.
* Who has been advocating for the anti-racism?
* From where does it come from: Politicians or citizens?
* And how these defenses takes place: through accusations (more violent) or by showing the absurdity of this sentiment (by pedagogy)?

## Proposed additional datasets 
We want to use the tool Empath as an additional dataset, which can  analyse text across hundreds of data-driven categories. It will help us to validate lexical categories, on demand, on our quotes. It is a dictionnary-based approaches about sentiment (see [Fast, Ethan, Binbin Chen, and Michael S. Bernstein. "Empath: Understanding topic signals in large-scale text." *Proceedings of the 2016 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems.* 2016.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.06979.pdf)).
The output produced by running Empath on a quote is a dictionary associating a float value to each of the above categories. Looking at these categories, we can define some as being "positive" or "negative" in the context of media coverage. We split these categories manually.

## Methods
The aim of this project would be to analyse the sentiment of quotes related to China thanks to an appropriate pre-trained model (*Empath tool, see in [additional datasets](#Proposed-additional-datasets) section*): ideally, we would be able to observe both the strength of the sentiment and the amount of polarised quotes within the dataset through time.
In order to do it, we will:
* To gain a better understanding of the source, quotes would be sorted by their most likely speaker, keeping only those of American nationality, and further sorted by their occupation.
* In addtition, to have more data, We add to the quotes those without most likely speaker but that come from an american paper.
* Show main evolutions of sinophobic sentiment throug graphs.
* We use the tool Empath to analyse our quotes and range them in categories of sentiments.
* We oppose analysis about sinophobic sentiment in the USA and analysis about anti-sinophobic sentiment.

## Proposed timeline
For the Milestone 2 we only used the quotes of 2020 to simplify our research. However, for Milestone 3, we will use quotes from 2015 to 2020 .

* Milestone 3.1 (week 9 & 10): Add quotations from american papers, statistical & graphical analysis for answering [Research Questions](#Research-Questions)
* Milestone 3.2 (week 11): Finish & review of research questions
* Milestone 3.3 (week 12 & 13): Notebook presentation & explanations, and bonus (Quotebank issue reporting) <br/>
=> Due: 17 Dec 2021

## Organization within the team 
Until project Milestone 3:
* *Zied:* finish to find which speaker is the good one + finish sort and filter the quotes
* *Kepler:* categorization of quotes with the Empath dataset
* *Francesca:* main evolutions of sinophobic sentiment + main observations
* *Anne:* oppose analysis about sinophobic sentiment in the USA and analysis about anti-sinophobic sentiment
* *all:* Bonus (Quotebank issue reporting)

## Questions for TAs 
* Pertinence of our analysis?
* Difficulty to categorise jobs/speaker occupations
* We use a custom weighting scheme to add weights to categories in Empath predictions. Is there a way to make sure this scheme is as objective as possible, or are the ideas of "positive" and "negative" inherently too subjective?
* The Empath model is able to detect concepts such as "trust" or "strength", but does not give any indication of their positive or negative context (i.e. "trust" and "mistrust" are equally detected under the "trust" category, and "strength" can both mean "a show of strength" or "a strong act of repression"). Is there a way to use Empath to obtain information about these contexts, or should we start looking for another tool?
